# Simulation in ROS with PX4 and Gazebo
This section is to illustrate how to build ROS-Gazebo simulation for the firmwares PX4 and Ardupilot.

[Single drone with PX4](2_1_Simulation_ROS_PX4.md) shows how to simulate a **single** quadrotor with the **PX4** firmware in Gazebo.

[Single drone with Ardupilot](2_2_Simulation_ROS_Ardupilot.md) explains the steps to simulate  a **single** quadrotor with the **Ardupilot** firmware in Gazebo.


## TODO
- Multiple drones with PX4
- Multiple drones with Ardupilot
